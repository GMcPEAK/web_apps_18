<h1>Assignment 1: Duplicate Me!</h1>

	For this assignment, you are to follow these instructions to duplicate what you see here as a web page. For example, the text above is the largest header you can create using a normal HTML tag. For this assignment, you will only need basic tags, without attributes, so no fancy stuff! Also, everything should be hand coded in a text editor. If I see the telltale junk that web design software puts in, then it will not be satisfactory homework.

<strong><em>This is strong and emphasized text!</em></strong>

<h2>OMG this is totally the 2nd biggest header. YES!</h2>

<ul>
	<li> Here we have an unordered list.</li>
	<li> I suppose I can note at this time that while you should have all the text I have, the font doesn't have to be identical, since it depends on your system.
</ul>

This haiku uses<br/>
line breaks to separate the<br/>
lines. Totally rad.<br/>
<br/>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>This</b></td> <td><b>is</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>a</b></td><td> <b>table</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>it</b></td> <td><b>has</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>four</b></td> <td><b>rows.</b></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Even though there are no lines between cells, the 4 lines above are in a table. Ok! Well that was &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ...easy?
